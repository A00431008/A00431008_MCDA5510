Assignment #1 - A00431008_MCDA5510
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The project walks through all the directories the TestDirectory recursively and takes input 
from all the csv files within the directories and combines into output.csv in the output folder.

The project has been forked from original https://github.com/DanielPenny/MCDA5510_Assignments 
and completed as an assignment of MCDA5510 course at SMU.

The main folder for the project is ./Assignment1/ProgAssign1 where all the changes has been saved

Path for the directory that is being walked through by the program: 
A00431008_MCDA5510/Assignment1/ProgAssign1/TestDirectory
(All the constituent files and directories within TestDirectory will be walked through by the program)

"Sample Data.zip" and "InClassDemo" folder has been added to .gitignore as they are not a part 
of the assignment

Additional description for how the program works has been provided in the Readme file at 
./Assignment1/ProgAssign1 folder
